## Experiments
2025-10-21:
- add nest_let_rec (requires re-enabling indir_call_ref_step), bringing failure rate to ???
```
test 52 is taking too long to generate (hours? i think it ran overnight and never finished)
is it an infinite loop somewhere?
clearly there's some issue w/ fuel counts because i don't the AST is actually 10 depth
is it performance of using the wrong Urn implementation?

test 51 is also taking a few minutes to generate ... is there some exponential thing happening?
```

2025-10-08:
- increased fuel to 10: failure rate down to 23%

2025-10-07:
- messed with the weights in generators.ml to get the failure (1 recursive call) rate down to 50%

2025-10-01: see directions in ~meeting-notes/2025-10-1-ll.md
Instructions:
- commit to replicate: see commit on 2025-10-04
- `dune exec -- sized_generator > my_file.txt`
- Generated code will be in `output/<unix timestamp>`
- run analysis.rkt on `my_file.txt` to get the 2 #s described below in scripts

## Scripts
analysis.rkt: prints out 2 vectors:
1. number of functions recorded in each test
2. the maximum number of recursive calls made in 1 function in each test
